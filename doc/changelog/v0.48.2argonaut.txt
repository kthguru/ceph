    upstart, ceph-create-keys: Make client.admin key generation automatic.
    
    This should help simplify Chef etc deployments. Now (when using the
    Upstart jobs), when a ceph-mon is started, ceph-create-admin-key is
    triggered. If /etc/ceph/$cluster.client.admin.keyring already exists,
    it does nothing; otherwise, it waits for ceph-mon to reach quorum, and
    then does a "ceph auth get-or-create" to create the key, and writes it
    atomically to disk.
    
    The equivalent code can be removed from the Chef cookbook once this is
    in.

    config: Add a per-name default keyring to front of keyring search path.
    
    This lets us have e.g. /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring that is
    owned by root:admin and mode u=rw,g=r,o= without making every non-root
    run of the command line tools complain and fail.
    
    This is what the Chef cookbook has been doing for a while already.

    upstart: Make ceph-osd always set the crush location.
    
    This used to be conditional on config having osd_crush_location set,
    but with that, minimal configuration left the OSD completely out of
    the crush map, and prevented the OSD from starting properly.
    
    Note: Ceph does not currently let this mechanism automatically move
    hosts to another location in the CRUSH hierarchy. This means if you
    let this run with defaults, setting osd_crush_location later will not
    take effect. Set up your config file (or Chef environment) fully
    before starting the OSDs the first time.

    Since we read usage in chunks we need to clear the
    usage map before reading the next chunk, otherwise
    we're going to aggregate the old data as well.
